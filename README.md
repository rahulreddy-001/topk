## Design a Highly Scalable Global Leaderboard System

This repository demonstrates a local simulation of a highly scalable
global leaderboard system for an online game.

Players continuously generate score updates, and clients frequently
request the **top K players** (e.g., top 10,000).

### Requirements

- Handle millions of players and tens of thousands of score updates per second
- Support very high read fan-out for leaderboard views

### Running the project locally

```bash
go mod tidy
make run
```
